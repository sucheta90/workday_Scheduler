# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

To accommodate the demanding 9-5 schedule, this application proves invaluable by serving as a visual depiction of an hourly to-do list. It incorporates a digital clock feature for enhanced functionality.

## Usage

- The time blocks are cleverly color-coded to represent past, present, and future hours, adding a visually intuitive element to the interface.
- Users have the flexibility to modify the time blocks according to their preferences and save the changes, ensuring that the data remains intact until they opt to clear the entire schedule.
